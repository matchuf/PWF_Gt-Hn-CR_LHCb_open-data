# PWF_Gt-Hn-CR_LHCb_open-data
Repository for the Physics Without Frontiers - Guatemala-Honduras-Costa Rica: Reading and manipulating the LHCb open data. [Indico website](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10914/)

To get started go to the file Getting_started.pdf, it contains the information about how to create a conda environment where all the python libraries will be installed.

Once your conda environment is ready, on Tuesday 10 you will find here the file open-data-project-1.1.tar.gz. Download and untar the file, the folder contains several files that you will need to run the main notebook, LHCb_Open_Data_Project_PWF.ipynb. Activate your conda environment, open the notebook and you will find there everything you need to start the hackathon challenge!
