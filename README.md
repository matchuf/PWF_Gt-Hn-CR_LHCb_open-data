# PWF_Gt-Hn-CR_LHCb_open-data
Repository for the Physics Without Frontiers - Guatemala-Honduras-Costa Rica: Reading and manipulating the LHCb open data. [Indico website](https://indico.ictp.it/event/10914/)

To get started go to the file Getting_started.pdf, it contains the information about how to create a conda environment where all the python libraries will be installed.

Once your conda environment is ready, on Tuesday 10 you will find here the file open-data-project-1.1.tar.gz. Download and untar the file, the folder contains several files that you will need to run the main notebook, LHCb_Open_Data_Project_PWF.ipynb. Activate your conda environment, open the notebook and you will find there everything you need to start the hackathon challenge!

In case you are having problems running the notebook from the conda environment, as an alternative you could try to run the notebook LHCb_Open_Data_Project_PWF_without-root.ipynb in google colab. Support material images and links might not load properly, but you could find all the material in the opendata-project-1.1 folder.

You can find the new version of the code open-data-project-1.2.tar.gz, it includes notebooks for the conda environment version and also for colab version. It fixes some errors, thanks to Jorge Cibrian and Sergio Arguedas.
